# Kickstand
Finds the closest bike rack to you in the city of Knoxville.

## Installation and Build

First, make sure you are on the **latest IOS version** as this application will not work and will crash if you are not on the latest IOS version.

Since this application was built entirely on XCode and the Swift programming language, you will **need** an iPhone to run this application.  


To run a simulation of the application, you will need 
 [XCode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/).  Keep in mind that XCode will only work on Mac OS.

Download the GitHub Repository and open the project file in the folder labeled **Kickstand.xcodeproj**.  Make sure the other folders are in the same directory before launching XCode with it.  



## User Manual
 
- Open the application.
- If asked for permission to use Location Services, **click yes**.
- The app will automatically route you to the nearest rack.  If you choose to pick a different bike rack, simply tap on a different pin on the map and the app will automatically re-route you to that pin.


## Known Bugs
- If moved to another location while the map is still open, a new route is not formed.
- Sometimes, on the first time a device opens the application, the route to the closest bike rack is not automatically routed.
